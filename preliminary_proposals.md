1) Predicting Steam item prices: https://steamcommunity.com/market/ 
Steam is a digit video game distribution platform that includes a marketplace
to buy and sell in-game items on their marketplace. I thought
it would be interesting to try to predict items prices, and it would be
fun to invest ~$100 into this market to see if I can make some money
with my predictions. I was thinking of comparing prices of items to the
popularity of that game, the reviews, the play time of people buying the
items (seems like a long shot to find that), whether the game had a
surge in popularity or not, etc. If people's profiles aren't private you
can see how long they've played all of their games, Steam tracks how
many people are playing all of their games at any given time, you can
look at price and quantity sold of any item up to a year ago... It seems
like there should be plenty of data available, but I'm not sure how
accessible it is. I've found 3rd party sites but I don't know how
reliable their data is or if it's okay not to have a first hand source.

I think a webapp would be fun and flashy, but I know I would spend way
way too long on insignificant parts of the webapp, so for the sake of my
project I plan to stay away from that. I'm not entirely sure what is
entailed in a web app though, so it's possible I could put together
something barebones that will function as a more dynamic slideshow.

My next steps are figuring out what kinds of data I can get my hands on
and whether or not secondary data sources are acceptable.

2) Song recommender It was done in the previous capstone, and I don't
know if a recommendation engine is a good thing to focus on or not, but
I enjoy listening to music so this is something else I would use. I
would be more inclined to use a web app for this project in order to
make it more functional. If I could draw the songs I listen to from
spotify I could compare my recommendation engine to theirs too.

There are several different places to draw data from. Genius lyrics,
last.fm, spotify... AWS has a "Million Song Dataset" so getting enough
data would not be a problem.

My next step would be deciding what subset of the 500GBs of data to use.
Maybe if I focus on one genre I could find more interesting things to
base the recommendations on.

3) I want to spend more time on Monday scouring for data sets. I haven't
come up with something I'm deeply curious about yet and ideally I would,
since I'm going to be working on this for two weeks. Either way, I'll find
one more proposal before Wednesday of next week.
