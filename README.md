# Steam Market Anomaly Detection _*Steam Logo*_
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) is the largest digital video game distribution platform. A subset of games on Steam include items that can be found in-game and sold to other players on [Steam's Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/). My hypothesis was that significant events in the community (new item releases, big updates, tournaments, etc.) would affect the prices of these items. My goal was to find a way to detect anomalies in the market and investigate those dates to see if they do in fact correspond to events.
